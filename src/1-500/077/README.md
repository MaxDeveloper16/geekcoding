# 77. Combinations
Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers out of 1 ... n.

## Example:

```Python
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output:
[
  [2,4],
  [3,4],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  [1,3],
  [1,4],
]
```

# Idea
Any time when you see a keyword "combination", backtracking algorithm should be in your hands as a candidate to solve this question.

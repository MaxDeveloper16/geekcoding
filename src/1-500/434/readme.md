This isn't a good problem because it solely relies the problem solver's ability to use one function well in most cases. However, I'm choosing to include it because I wasn't quite sure if I know all the string functions well enough to deal with all variations of basic string manipulation questions.

It's simply a reminder to myself and maybe others that I should make time to spend on a particular language before I can confidently say I have a level of proficiency in it.
